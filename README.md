The scripts in the base directory are the most important.

`html_download.py` downloads the HTML files. `html_analysis.py` parses them.

Code is written by [Charles Miele](https://www.charlesmiele.com). The Python scripts in the main directory are the most important ones.

`analysis` includes Jupyter notebooks that are used to analyze the HTML data report created by `html_analysis.py`

`scripts` includes more Python scripts that are more complimentary to the ones in the main directory.

`log-reports` includes CSV files that were used for debugging during the data collection process. They're not very useful at this point in the project, mostly here for archive purposes (and they don't take up very much space).

**There is no data stored in this repository. It would take up way too much space.**
