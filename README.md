All code is by Charles Miele. The Python scripts in the main directory are the most important ones.

`analysis` includes Jupyter notebooks that are used to analyze the HTML data report created by `html_analysis.py`

`scripts` includes more Python scripts that are more complimentary to the ones in the main directory.

`log-reports` includes CSV files that were used for debugging during the data collection process. They're most stored for archive purposes.

**There is no data stored in this repository. It would take up way too much space.**
