                    	<p>Turnstoneâs founders are world-leaders in the oncolytic virus field and were not satisfied with traditional immunotherapy approaches, so they screened hundreds of viruses from around the world and discovered that Maraba, a single-stranded RNA virus isolated from Brazilian sand flies, had the ideal characteristics for a viral-based therapy</p>

                                                        Dr. David Stojdl has pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumour-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa, and was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (San Francisco, USA; later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics). He obtained his Ph.D from the University of Ottawa, and earned Bachelors and Masters degrees in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of Western Ontario.                                                        </div>

                                                        Dr. David Stojdl has pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumour-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa, and was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (San Francisco, USA; later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics). He obtained his Ph.D from the University of Ottawa, and earned Bachelors and Masters degrees in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of Western Ontario.                                                        </div>
