				<p>The Foundation: Maraba is the Ideal Oncolytic Virus</p>
<p>The Maraba platform represents Turnstoneâs lead oncolytic immunotherapy agent. Maraba was bioselected from rhabdovirus isolates from around the world as the most potent tumor lytic strain. The final product was developed through iterative genetic engineering of Maraba to maximize its inherent safety and potency profile. Highlights of the platform include: potent killing of most tumor cell types, highly attenuated in normal human cells, no pre-existing immunity, systemic administration and activity, and ease of manufacturing.</p>

<p>The Evolution: Maraba is also the Ideal T Cell Vaccine</p>
<p>To complement the powerful tumor destructive properties of the Maraba oncolytic virus, Turnstone has further engineered Maraba to act as an incredibly effective T cell vaccine driving the immune system to target the tumor for destruction. This innovation is achieved by encoding tumor antigens into Marabaâs genetic code. When administered systemically, it triggers a massive amplification of T cell immune responses targeted to the antigens present on the tumor cells, and facilitates long-term immune recognition.</p>

<p>Currently in clinical development, this exciting new technology is able to focus the immune system on the antigen expressing tumors thereby enhancing oncolytic potency, tumor specificity, and overall sustained anti-cancer immune responses. The Maraba oncolytic viral immunotherapy platform is a vanguard technology representing a disruptive approach in the treatment of cancer.</p>

                                                        <p>Dr. David Stojdl has pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumour-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa, and was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (San Francisco, USA; later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics). He obtained his Ph.D from the University of Ottawa, and earned Bachelors and Masters degrees in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of Western Ontario.</p>

                                                        Dr. David Stojdl has pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumour-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa, and was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (San Francisco, USA; later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics). He obtained his Ph.D from the University of Ottawa, and earned Bachelors and Masters degrees in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of Western Ontario.                                                        </div>
