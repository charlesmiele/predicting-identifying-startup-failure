<h2 style="text-align: center;">Breakthrough Viral Immunotherapies</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Turnstone Biologics is the sole company developing viral immunotherapies that drive benefit through simultaneous generation of targeted immune responses and modulation of the tumor environment.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">The Maraba Virus</h6>
<p>Turnstone Biologics’ founders screened hundreds of viruses before discovering that Maraba, a single-stranded RNA virus isolated from sand flies around the Maraba region of Brazil, was an optimal platform for cancer therapeutics. Maraba was engineered to MG1 to optimize its safety, selectivity, manufacturability and potency to kill tumor cells, and transgene capacity was added for targeted expression of tumor-associated antigens and immunomodulatory agents.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive img-wide" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20180528140842im_/https://turnstonebio.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/maraba.png" alt=""/></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">MG1: The First 2-In-1 Approach</h6>
<p>Our engineered oncolytic Maraba virus, known as MG1, is the first therapeutic 2-in-1 approach to combine an oncolytic virus and an antigen-specific cancer vaccine. With its unprecedented dual-mechanism driving robust killer T cell responses and disrupting the tumor microenvironment, MG1 kills cancer cells at metastatic sites throughout the body, and generates a durable immune response resulting in long-term memory to prevent recurrence.</p>

                        	Immunotherapies are transforming cancer care but benefit only a minority of patients. Disruptive approaches are required to deliver on the promise of the body’s natural killer T cells to recognize, find, and kill cancer. Viral immunotherapies can reverse the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenviroment to make it permissible to T cell attack, as well as generate strong, tumor-specific T cell responses.

Turnstone Biologics’ founders screened hundreds of viruses before discovering that Maraba, a single-stranded RNA virus isolated from sand flies around the Maraba region of Brazil, was an optimal platform for cancer therapeutics. Maraba was engineered to optimize its safety, selectivity, manufacturability and potency to kill tumor cells, and transgene capacity was added for targeted expression of tumor-associated antigens and immunomodulatory agents.

Our engineered oncolytic Maraba virus, known as MG1, is the first therapeutic 2-in-1 approach to combine an oncolytic virus and an antigen-specific cancer vaccine. With its unprecedented dual-mechanism driving robust killer T cell responses and disrupting the tumor microenvironment, MG1 kills cancer cells at metastatic sites throughout the body, and generates a durable immune response resulting in long-term memory to prevent recurrence.                        </div>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Driven by Science and Innovation</h2>
<p>At Turnstone Biologics, we are science-driven: science informs our research, clinical development and approach for patients. We have developed a robust pipeline of new medicines for multiple solid tumors.</p>
<p>Our first program is an engineered Maraba virus (MG1) that expresses the tumor-associated antigen MAGEA3, which is highly expressed on many different types of solid tumors. We are evaluating this therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer and esophageal cancer in two clinical trials – alone and in combination with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda™. We expect to begin human studies with our second MG1 therapy for patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) positive tumors in 2018, and have multiple other viral immunotherapies in development.</p>

                                                        <p>Dr. David Stojdl pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumor-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa. He was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics). He received a Ph.D. from the University of Ottawa and an M.S. and B.S. in microbiology and immunology from the University of Western Ontario.</p>

<p><strong>What’s in it for you?</strong></p>
<p>In this role, you will have the opportunity to own and drive the scientific and technical development of analytical assays for release and characterization testing of our live-virus platform technology of novel biotherapeutics to combat cancer. On the heels of a successful Series B financing, Turnstone’s CMC team is expanding to support the development of several parallel candidates towards the clinic. Joining Turnstone at this early phase, will allow you to actively participate in developing a role designed just for you: one that leverages your expertise, while challenging you to develop new skills. This role will include partnering very closely with our Manufacturing Sciences &amp; Technology group and Quality Control team, to generate assays that are relevant and cutting edge. This role will require a close interaction and management of our analytical vendors across the world to ensure timely, scientifically sound, and quality results are generated. Assay qualification and validation efforts have already begun but will need further development and guidance. This is a great learning opportunity to work hand-in-glove with Quality Control to prepare our assays for late-stage clinical development, with line-of-sight towards commercial launch, while also enabling an explosive early-stage clinical pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>How do you know if you’re the right fit?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine coming to work every day where over-communication, transparency, teaching, listening, asking, thinking, working hard, and having fun are normal – actually, expected? Imagine having a coach, mentor, peers, and partners where candid feedback, self-improvement, risk taking, failing, learning from that failing, and succeeding are what we call ‘another Tuesday at Turnstone’? At Turnstone, the science drives decision making, and our drugs are designed with the patient in mind. Like the disease we’re fighting, our platform is complex, and transformative. If you’re a passionate person, and our science excites you – this opportunity may be for you.</p>
<p>If you are interested in managing and driving analytical development for an early clinical-stage company, where you take on a scientific and sometimes vendor management role, while rolling up your sleeves, then this role may be for you! Your role will partner closely with Quality Control and Manufacturing Sciences &amp; Technology to understand the product and processes as well as the quality system within which we work.</p>
<p>You will interface directly with analytical vendors to drive the development of virological, biophysical, biochemical, and molecular assays to reliably and accurately characterize our product. These assays will support the GMP release and characterization of drug product destined for the clinic, as well as support product and process characterization, comparability, stability, and other studies within the CMC team needs. You’ll have experience working with some or all the following, as they relate to analytical development and methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live-virus methods such as titering, genome quantitation by qPCR, neutralizing antibody assays, plaque forming unit assays, etc</li>
<li>Biophysical particle measurements such as HPLC, DLS, and nanosight</li>
<li>Assay development and reporting</li>
<li>Assay qualification and validation according to principles in ICH Q2</li>
<li>Working closely with external CROs and vendors to drive projects to completion in a timely and scientifically sound manner</li>
<li>Quality systems (change control, deviations, corrective and preventive actions, document control)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The details</strong></p>
<p>This role is best suited for a scientist with experience working in a biotech analytical lab, with both hands-on and preferably 5 or more years of leading complex projects, perhaps including the coaching and supervising of either a team you were directly responsible for, or the team of an external vendor. You’ve likely achieved either a Masters or PhD in a relevant scientific discipline and are looking to use your knowledge in a meaningful and impactful way, while also learning about new methods, products, and processes. You are not hesitant to roll-up your sleeves and drive a project forward, while also being able to handle a large to-do list by prioritizing and discussing creative solutions with your colleagues. You have demonstrated the ability to manage both small and large projects, multi-tasking effectively, and having an external presence that is professional, collaborative, and influential. You will need to travel on occasion to our various vendors, and also visit our Ottawa and NYC offices often to stay connected, productive, and excited. This role will report to the Group Leader of Analytical Development and Quality Control at Turnstone. Based on a mutual discussion of fit, the successful candidate(s) will reside at either the Ottawa or New York office location.</p>

<ul>
<li>Inventory and Enterprise Resource Management systems</li>
<li>Procurement systems</li>
<li>Critical logistics, including import/export, cold chain, and time-sensitive shipping</li>
<li>External vendors, including critical material suppliers and contract development/manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), contract testing organizations (CTOs), and contract research organizations (CROs)</li>
<li>Warehouse materials management, including receipt, storage, issuance, and shipping, preferably at multiple sites</li>
<li>Quality systems (change control, deviations, corrective and preventive actions, document control)</li>
<li>Experience with Lean principles, Kanban, Just-In-Time logistics, Continuous Improvement, etc. are a plus. This is definitely a ‘hands-on’ role with incredible upside opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The details</strong></p>

You have demonstrated the ability to manage both small and large projects, multi-tasking effectively, and having an external presence that is professional, collaborative, and influential. You will need to travel monthly to our various vendors, and also visit our Ottawa and NYC offices often to stay connected, productive, and excited. This role will report to the Vice President of CMC/Manufacturing at Turnstone and be a part of the CMC Leadership Team. Based on a mutual discussion of fit, the successful candidate(s) will reside at either the Ottawa or New York office location.</p>

Our first-in-class platform technology attacks tumours using a two-pronged approach: targeted and robust tumour killing using an oncolytic virus, in combination with a cancer vaccine that generates long-lasting anti-tumour immune responses. Turnstone is building a world-class, high-performing CMC team that embraces being a learning organization with a sense of urgency, where CMC is a differentiator and enabler rather than a cost-center. Turnstone has a seasoned board of directors and venture capital partners, is enrolling clinical studies, has a rich development portfolio, and highly active R&amp;D efforts led by a world-class scientific management team. Turnstone is co-located in Ottawa, Canada and New York, USA.

<p><strong>What’s in it for you?</strong></p>
<p>In this role, you will have the opportunity to lead, drive, and own GMP clinical manufacturing operations for a suite of novel biotherapeutics to combat cancer. On the heels of a successful Series B financing, Turnstone’s CMC team is expanding to support the development of several parallel candidates towards the clinic. Joining Turnstone at this early phase, will allow you to actively participate in developing a role designed just for you: one that leverages your expertise, while challenging you to develop new skills. This role will include partnering very closely with our Manufacturing Sciences &amp; Technology group to understand the Drug Substance and Drug Product processes, with a collaborative effort to successfully transfer those processes to our network of CDMOs. Once transferred, you will lead all manufacturing operations including batch production record management, manufacturing schedule, providing ‘on-the-floor’ review and support as required, and overcoming challenges related to manufacturing deviations. You are truly the relationship manager and interface between Turnstone Biologics and our Manufacturing partners, representing us with the professionalism, creativity, and collaborative spirit that embodies who we are. Fortunately, the Turnstone CMC team has already initiated two clinical studies with Health Canada, so you’re not starting from zero, but we need someone to really own, drive, and lead our manufacturing operations, showing us how the professionals do it, all while remaining flexible, dynamic, working with a sense of urgency, and innovation. This is definitely a ‘roll up your sleeves’ role, but we’re hiring a leader that is setting the foundation for mature, manufacturing operations capable of supporting late-stage (Ph3/Pivotal) clinical studies, and commercial launch – you will bring the vision.</p>
<p><strong>How do you know if you’re the right fit?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine coming to work every day where over-communication, transparency, teaching, listening, asking, thinking, working hard, and having fun are normal – actually, expected? Imagine having a coach, mentor, peers, and partners where candid feedback, self-improvement, risk taking, failing, learning from that failing, and succeeding are what we call ‘another Wednesday at Turnstone’? At Turnstone, the science drives decision making, and our drugs are designed with the patient in mind. Like the disease we’re fighting, our platform is complex, and transformative. If you’re a passionate person, and our science excites you – this opportunity may be for you. If you are interested in leading, driving, and owning manufacturing operations for an early clinical-stage company, where you need to both provide vision and strategy while rolling up your sleeves, then this role may be for you! You’ll enjoy a diverse role as you partner closely with various groups such as Manufacturing Sciences &amp; Technology, Analytical Development and Quality Control, Supply Chain, Quality Assurance, and Clinical Operations. You will have led GMP manufacturing operations for complex biopharmaceuticals, ideally live-virus vaccines or similar, and will have both clinical and commercial manufacturing experience. You’ll use your well-developed communication skills and ability to influence and partner very closely with our networks of CDMOs and internal stakeholders at all levels.  You’ll have experience working with some or all the following, as they relate to manufacturing operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live-virus manufacturing experience, ideally hands-on as well as leading broader manufacturing teams or projects partners with external vendors</li>
<li>Very well versed in GMPs with a clear understading of ‘phase-appropriateness’ as well as an appreciation for continuous improvement</li>
<li>A relationship manager and primary interface for external vendors, including critical material suppliers and contract development/manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), contract testing organizations (CTOs), and contract research organizations (CROs)</li>
<li>Quality systems (change control, deviations, corrective and preventive actions, document control)</li>
<li>Experience with Lean principles, Kanban, Continuous Improvement, etc. are a plus. This is definitely a ‘hands-on’ role with incredible upside opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The details</strong></p>
<p>This role is best suited for manufacturing professionals with significant experience developing and managing a GMP manufacturing operation. You’re likely a classically trained scientist/engineer and supplemented your education to be successful, particularly with training in operational excellence and manufacturing. You must be able to demonstate both leadership and a willingness to be a ‘do-er’, likely having 5 years or more experience in GMP clinical or commercial manufacturing. You have demonstrated the ability to manage both small and large projects, multi-tasking effectively, and having an external presence that is professional, collaborative, and influential. You will need to travel monthly to our various vendors, and also visit our Ottawa and NYC offices often to stay connected, productive, and excited. This role will report to the Vice President of CMC/Manufacturing at Turnstone and be a part of the CMC Leadership Team.
