<h2 style="text-align: center;">Breakthrough Viral Immunotherapies</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Turnstone Biologics is developing a disruptive class of engineered viral immunotherapies, attacking cancer&#8217;s complexity with medicines designed to fight tumors at multiple points of intervention, including simultaneous generation of targeted immune responses and modulation of the tumor environment.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">The Vaccinia Virus</h6>
<p>Turnstone’s proprietary vaccinia virus platform has been engineered to stimulate the immune system, drive antigen presentation and recognition, and re-shape the tumor microenvironment. The high degree of tumor selectivity and large transgene capacity of the virus can be utilized to deliver other agents and therapeutics directly to sites of tumors throughout the body for local expression, reducing their potential for systemic toxicity.</p>
<p>RIVAL-01 is Turnstone’s lead candidate consisting of the vaccinia virus backbone encoding three potent immunomodulators, Flt3 ligand, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, and IL-12 cytokine, specifically designed to work together to drive immune activity and re-program the microenvironment to be best suited for tumor eradication. When the vaccinia virus enters and replicates in cancer cells throughout the body, the transgenes are expressed. The resulting local production of these therapeutics at the site of tumors add to the inherent oncolytic and microenvironment modifying properties of the virus to form a powerful multi-modal attack on the disease.</p>

                        	Immunotherapies are transforming cancer care but benefit only a minority of patients. Disruptive approaches are required to deliver on the promise of the body’s natural killer T cells to recognize, find, and kill cancer. Viral immunotherapies can reverse the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenviroment to make it permissible to T cell attack, as well as generate strong, tumor-specific T cell responses.

                        	<h6 style="text-align: center;">The Maraba Virus</h6>
Turnstone Biologics’ founders screened hundreds of viruses before discovering that Maraba, a single-stranded RNA virus isolated from sand flies around the Maraba region of Brazil, was an optimal platform for cancer therapeutics. Maraba was engineered to optimize its safety, selectivity, manufacturability and potency to kill tumor cells, and transgene capacity was added for targeted expression of tumor-associated antigens and immunomodulatory agents.

                        	<h6 style="text-align: center;">MG1: The First 2-In-1 Approach</h6>
Our engineered oncolytic Maraba virus, known as MG1, is the first therapeutic 2-in-1 approach to combine an oncolytic virus and an antigen-specific cancer vaccine. With its unprecedented dual-mechanism driving robust killer T cell responses and disrupting the tumor microenvironment, MG1 kills cancer cells at metastatic sites throughout the body, and generates a durable immune response resulting in long-term memory to prevent recurrence.                        </div>

                                                        <p>Dr. David Stojdl pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumor-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa. He was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics). He received a Ph.D. from the University of Ottawa and an M.S. and B.S. in microbiology and immunology from the University of Western Ontario.</p>

                                                        <p>Dr. David Stojdl pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumor-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa. He was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics). He received a Ph.D. from the University of Ottawa and an M.S. and B.S. in microbiology and immunology from the University of Western Ontario.</p>
