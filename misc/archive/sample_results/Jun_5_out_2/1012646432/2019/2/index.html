<h2 style="text-align: center;">Breakthrough Viral Immunotherapies</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Turnstone Biologics is the sole company developing viral immunotherapies that drive benefit through simultaneous generation of targeted immune responses and modulation of the tumor environment.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">The Maraba Virus</h6>
<p>Turnstone Biologics’ founders screened hundreds of viruses before discovering that Maraba, a single-stranded RNA virus isolated from sand flies around the Maraba region of Brazil, was an optimal platform for cancer therapeutics. Maraba was engineered to MG1 to optimize its safety, selectivity, manufacturability and potency to kill tumor cells, and transgene capacity was added for targeted expression of tumor-associated antigens and immunomodulatory agents.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive img-wide" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190226004239im_/https://turnstonebio.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/maraba.png" alt=""/></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">MG1: The First 2-In-1 Approach</h6>
<p>Our engineered oncolytic Maraba virus, known as MG1, is the first therapeutic 2-in-1 approach to combine an oncolytic virus and an antigen-specific cancer vaccine. With its unprecedented dual-mechanism driving robust killer T cell responses and disrupting the tumor microenvironment, MG1 kills cancer cells at metastatic sites throughout the body, and generates a durable immune response resulting in long-term memory to prevent recurrence.</p>

                        	Immunotherapies are transforming cancer care but benefit only a minority of patients. Disruptive approaches are required to deliver on the promise of the body’s natural killer T cells to recognize, find, and kill cancer. Viral immunotherapies can reverse the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenviroment to make it permissible to T cell attack, as well as generate strong, tumor-specific T cell responses.

Turnstone Biologics’ founders screened hundreds of viruses before discovering that Maraba, a single-stranded RNA virus isolated from sand flies around the Maraba region of Brazil, was an optimal platform for cancer therapeutics. Maraba was engineered to optimize its safety, selectivity, manufacturability and potency to kill tumor cells, and transgene capacity was added for targeted expression of tumor-associated antigens and immunomodulatory agents.

Our engineered oncolytic Maraba virus, known as MG1, is the first therapeutic 2-in-1 approach to combine an oncolytic virus and an antigen-specific cancer vaccine. With its unprecedented dual-mechanism driving robust killer T cell responses and disrupting the tumor microenvironment, MG1 kills cancer cells at metastatic sites throughout the body, and generates a durable immune response resulting in long-term memory to prevent recurrence.                        </div>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Driven by Science and Innovation</h2>
<p>At Turnstone Biologics, we are science-driven: science informs our research, clinical development and approach for patients. We have developed a robust pipeline of new medicines for multiple solid tumors.</p>
<p>Our first program is an engineered Maraba virus (MG1) that expresses the tumor-associated antigen MAGEA3, which is highly expressed on many different types of solid tumors. We are evaluating this therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer and esophageal cancer in two clinical trials – alone and in combination with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda™. We expect to begin human studies with our second MG1 therapy for patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) positive tumors in 2018, and have multiple other viral immunotherapies in development.</p>

                                                        <p>Dr. David Stojdl pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumor-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa. He was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics).

                                                        <p>Dr. David Stojdl pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumor-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa. He was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics). He received a Ph.D. from the University of Ottawa and an M.S. and B.S. in microbiology and immunology from the University of Western Ontario.</p>
