<h2 style="text-align: center;">Breakthrough Viral Immunotherapies</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Turnstone Biologics is developing a disruptive class of engineered viral immunotherapies, attacking cancer&#8217;s complexity with medicines designed to fight tumors at multiple points of intervention, including simultaneous generation of targeted immune responses and modulation of the tumor environment.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">The Vaccinia Virus</h6>
<p style="text-align: center;">Turnstone’s proprietary vaccinia virus platform has been engineered to stimulate the immune system, drive antigen presentation and recognition, and re-shape the tumor microenvironment. The high degree of tumor selectivity and large transgene capacity of the virus can be utilized to deliver other agents and therapeutics directly to sites of tumors throughout the body for local expression, reducing their potential for systemic toxicity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RIVAL-01 is Turnstone’s lead candidate consisting of the vaccinia virus backbone encoding three potent immunomodulators, Flt3 ligand, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, and IL-12 cytokine, specifically designed to work together to drive immune activity and re-program the microenvironment to be best suited for tumor eradication. When the vaccinia virus enters and replicates in cancer cells throughout the body, the transgenes are expressed. The resulting local production of these therapeutics at the site of tumors add to the inherent oncolytic and microenvironment modifying properties of the virus to form a powerful multi-modal attack on the disease.</p>

                        	Immunotherapies are transforming cancer care but benefit only a minority of patients. Disruptive approaches are required to deliver on the promise of the body’s natural killer T cells to recognize, find, and kill cancer. Viral immunotherapies can reverse the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenviroment to make it permissible to T cell attack, as well as generate strong, tumor-specific T cell responses.

Turnstone Biologics’ founders screened hundreds of viruses before discovering that Maraba, a single-stranded RNA virus isolated from sand flies around the Maraba region of Brazil, was an optimal platform for cancer therapeutics. Maraba was engineered to optimize its safety, selectivity, manufacturability and potency to kill tumor cells, and transgene capacity was added for targeted expression of tumor-associated antigens and immunomodulatory agents.

                        	<h6 style="text-align: center;">MG1: The First 2-In-1 Approach</h6>
Our engineered oncolytic Maraba virus, known as MG1, is the first therapeutic 2-in-1 approach to combine an oncolytic virus and an antigen-specific cancer vaccine. With its unprecedented dual-mechanism driving robust killer T cell responses and disrupting the tumor microenvironment, MG1 kills cancer cells at metastatic sites throughout the body, and generates a durable immune response resulting in long-term memory to prevent recurrence.                        </div>

                                                        <p>Dr. David Stojdl pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumor-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa. He was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics). He received a Ph.D. from the University of Ottawa and an M.S. and B.S. in microbiology and immunology from the University of Western Ontario.</p>

                                                        <p>Dr. David Stojdl pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumor-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa. He was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics). He received a Ph.D. from the University of Ottawa and an M.S. and B.S. in microbiology and immunology from the University of Western Ontario.</p>

<p><strong>Position Overview:</strong><br/>
Imagine coming to work every day where over-communication, transparency, teaching, listening, asking, thinking, working hard, and having fun are normal – actually, expected? Imagine having a coach, mentor, peers, and partners where candid feedback, self-improvement, risk taking, failing, learning from that failing, and succeeding are what we call ‘another day at Turnstone’? At Turnstone, the science drives decision making, and our drugs are designed with the patient in mind. Like the disease we’re fighting, our platform is complex, and transformative. If you’re a passionate person, and our science excites you – this opportunity may be for you. </p>
<p>Position Overview:</p>
<p>In this role, you will have the opportunity to lead a team of dedicated and high-performing scientists to direct the development and qualification of analytical assays for release and characterization testing of our platform technologies of novel biotherapeutics, from live virus products to synthetic peptide vaccines.  This team also heavily supports analytics for preclinical animal studies.  Current products are in early clinical development and so many assays are at the starting line of their analytical life cycle management.  This is an opportunity to establish rigorous and far reaching processes for assay qualification and validation, with an eye to Phase 3 and beyond.  This role will necessitate partnering very closely with many other teams within Technical Operations (Bioprocess Engineering, Manufacturing Sciences, Quality Control, Analytical Operations, Quality Assurance), Regulatory Affairs, and  Research (preclinical studies) to generate assays that are relevant and cutting edge.  The associate director of analytical development will also be involved at times in meetings with external parties in support of regulatory interactions, diligence meetings, business partnerships, etc.  This role will have elements of technical oversight, helping the team strategize and investigate technical problems, and operational oversight, ensuring that resources are used wisely and the team is supported in their efforts.  </p>
<p>We are looking for a scientist that enjoys working as a team and growing as a leader, someone that believes that WHAT we do and HOW we do it are both critical to success.  We are looking for a leader that can prioritize a heavy workload where resources are always limiting, supporting higher level discussions around regulatory implications and employee career development, as well as someone that is willing to roll up their sleeves and pitch in on the ground floor when required.  You’ll have experience working with some or all the following, as they relate to analytical development:</p>
<p>Priority areas of interest:<br/>
•	Biophysical and analytical chemical methods that support particle measurements, virus particle state assessment, and protein profiling with special attention to HPLC-based methods.  Understanding of other related methods such as LC-MS, DLS, zetasizer, nanosight, FFF-MALS, etc are considered an asset.<br/>
•	In depth knowledge of the methods, instruments, and regulatory considerations of next generation sequencing and it’s use in GMP environments considered an asset<br/>
•	Experience developing qPCR methods for GMP an asset</p>
<p>Secondary areas of interest (already well supported within the team, but further asset in understanding critical methods):  Cellular and molecular methods such as virus titering by plaque assay, genome quantitation by qPCR, impurity assessment by ELISA or qPCR, etc.<br/>
•	Developing analytics for biological product characterization and release, experience with live virus products an asset<br/>
•	Engaging in discussions with colleagues on their analytical needs, assessing/investigating various technologies to support those needs, and making decisions on technologies to pursue<br/>
•	Supporting Quality Control scientists in their suspect results investigations to ascertain root cause and path forward<br/>
•	Developing methods to support GMP product characterization or release and supporting the method life cycle management<br/>
•	Developing methods to support preclinical studies to interrogate virus or protein levels in animal tissues – GLP knowledge an asset<br/>
•	Performing or managing assay qualification and validation according to principles in ICH Q2, especially as is appropriate to support early clinical development<br/>
•	Working closely with external CROs and vendors to drive projects to completion in a timely and scientifically sound manner<br/>
•	Act as subject matter expert in analytical development during diligence and regulatory interactions<br/>
•	Experience working within GMP quality systems is a must (change control, deviations, corrective and preventive actions, document control)</p>
<p><strong>What’s in it for you?</strong><br/>
In this role, you will have the opportunity to develop your ability to think both strategically and drive fast-paced execution.  With our company size and growth we will give you plenty of opportunities for you to be an inspirational and collaborative co-functional leader.  Passionate about being a part of a critical function of a growing company and continuous learning?  We will have plenty of that for you!  </p>
<p>We are in the early stages of building strategies, structures and process so this role will be busy and expanding. You would have the opportunity to create something new and ‘WOW!’ all of us and grow right along with the company.</p>
<p><strong>Experience &amp; Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
Qualifications:</p>
<p>This role is best suited for a scientist with 8+ years experience in directly leading analytical method development and qualification of complex biologics in support of GMP clinical product release, leading complex projects, and supporting regulatory submissions.  Candidates for this roles will have directly coached and supervised a team of analytical scientists for at least 5 years and worked with external vendors to achieve a project goal.  Candidates have likely achieved either a Masters or PhD in a relevant scientific discipline and are looking to use their knowledge in a meaningful and impactful way, while also learning about new methods, products, and processes. Candidates with less formal academic training may also be considered, but having more deep, diverse, and extensive experience will be crucial.  Learning agility is critical as the methods leveraged by the Turnstone CMC analytics team are extremely broad and cutting edge.  Candidates have demonstrated the ability to manage both small and large projects, multi-tasking effectively, and having an external presence that is professional, collaborative, and influential.  </p>
<p>Travel during the COVID-19 pandemic is highly restricted and unlikely to be necessary.  However, upon resumption of regular office life, you will need to travel on occasion to our various vendors (global) and also visit our Ottawa and NYC offices often to stay connected, productive, and excited. This role will report to the Director of Analytical Development and Quality Control at Turnstone. Based on a mutual discussion of fit, the successful candidate(s) will reside at either the Ottawa or New York office location, though special consideration will be given to anyone living in eastern North America who is able to travel on occasion (post COVID-19).  </p>
