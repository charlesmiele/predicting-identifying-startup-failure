                                                        <p>Dr. David Stojdl pioneered the exploration of host-virus interactions critical to oncolytic therapy to guide the clinical development of more effective virus platforms. At the Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, he first identified VSV as an oncolytic virus and defined the archetypal role of interferon signaling in tumor-specific oncolytic virus targeting. Since joining the CHEO Research Institute in 2004, Dr. Stojdl has discovered and developed several novel oncolytic vector platforms, including the Maraba oncolytic virus platform. Dr. Stojdl also directs the CHEO Automated Screening Centre (CASC), leveraging state-of-the-art high-throughput robotic screening technology to uncover new insights for the clinical development of oncolytic virus biotherapies. Dr. Stojdl is a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa. He was a scientific co-founder and consultant to Jennerex Biotherapeutics (later acquired by SillaJen Biotherapeutics). He received a Ph.D. from the University of Ottawa and an M.S. and B.S. in microbiology and immunology from the University of Western Ontario.</p>

<p>The responsibilities and critical expectations include the following:</p>
<p>1.	Some QA professionals will provide regulatory guidelines, guidance documents, position papers, or other resources that are supplied by various regulatory bodies and/or trade organizations to help guide development. We are not looking for someone to provide those resources. We are looking for someone who deeply understands our science, our patients, our products, and our context, and provides interpretations, proposals, recommendations, and solutions of how we might apply those resources.  We need hands-on problem solvers.<br/>
2.	Some QA professionals will review development, manufacturing, and testing approaches, SOPs, batch records, and supply chain documentation and identify deviations, gaps, issues, and challenges that need to be addressed, and then pass those on. We are looking for a QA professional where supply of product – compliant, right-first-time, all the time, every time – is part of their core responsibilities. QA is as responsible for supply as manufacturing operations, manufacturing sciences, project management, QC regulatory affairs, and everyone else in the team. We own it, together.</p>
<p>If you share the above core philosophy, then below are some of the activities you will channel those core beliefs into:</p>
<p>•	Develop, establish and maintain QA programs, policies, and procedures to ensure GxP compliance of clinical trial material.<br/>

•	Perform rapid and agile record review and disposition activities for clinical trial material including manufacturing, testing and labelling/packaging batch records<br/>
•	Lead extensive investigations with vendors and interdepartmental teams to determine product quality impact and resolve potential product quality issues.<br/>
•	Oversee the generation, review and/or disposition of internal and external documents used in GxP activities.<br/>
•	Act as the single point of QA contact with vendors, contract facilities and joint development collaborators for contracts, validation activities, change management and other QA issues<br/>
•	Drive the implementation of other quality systems, including departmental and corporate procedures, to ensure compliance with GxPs.<br/>
•	Interpret regulatory agency policies and guidance as it pertains to QA issues.<br/>
•	Review CMC documents submitted to regulatory agencies.<br/>
•	Develop work instructions and/or standard operating procedures </p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s in it for you?</strong> </p>
<p>In this role, you will have the opportunity to develop your ability to think both strategically and drive fast-paced execution.  With our company size and growth we will give you plenty of opportunities for you to be an inspirational and collaborative co-functional leader.  Passionate about being a part of a critical function of a growing company and continuous learning?  We will have plenty of that for you!  </p>
<p>We are in the early stages of building strategies, structures and process so this role will be busy and expanding. We also have opportinites for you to be a mentor to other team members. You would have the opportunity to create something new and ‘WOW!’ all of us and grow right along with the company.</p>
<p><strong>Experience &amp; Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<p>This role is best suited for someone with the following:</p>
<p>•	BA/BS Degree, with an advanced degree preferred<br/>
•	Minimum of 8+ years of operational quality assurance and GxP compliance. Requires manufacturing experience in a pharma or biotech environment, ideally across a full range of multiple clinical development phases<br/>
•	Prior experience with quality systems and advancing novel autologous therapeutics from preclinical stages through IND to BLA (or EU equivalents) is desired.  Understanding of the biologics and  cell therapy manufacturing process in GXP environments.<br/>
•	Experience with regulatory authority or client/partner inspections/audits, and conduct of supplier/manufacturer audits.<br/>
•	Knowledge of GMP, FDA and EMA regulatory requirements applicable to Biologics including Cell/Gene/Viral therapy products<br/>
•	Strong knowledge of current industry trends and the ability to use the latest technologies<br/>
•	Experience with computer system validation (CSV)  and knowledge of CFR Part 11 compliance would be an asset.<br/>
•	Demonstrated ability to manage multiple projects and variable workloads with demanding timelines.<br/>
•	Strong interpersonal, teamwork, and organizational skills; effective oral and written communication skills.<br/>
•	The candidate must exude a mature communication style that matches the Turnstone style: respectful, transparent, with a high degree of integrity and humility</p>
