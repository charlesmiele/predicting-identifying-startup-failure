            and deliver incoming e-mail. The school's computer system and antenna

            day in a computer strapped to the back of the motorcycle. At dusk, 
            the motorcycles converge on the provincial capital, Ban Lung, where

          <p><font size="2" face="helvetica, verdana">In the hills of northeastern 
            Cambodia, five men on motorcycles are connecting rural villages to 
            one another, their government, medical specialists and the Internet... 
            the Village Area Networking Kit is expected to be priced at $500 to 
            $600 when released, a fraction of the cost of the electricity and 
            communications infrastructure that would otherwise be necessary to 
            deliver e-mail to the villages.<br>

          <p><font size="2" face="helvetica, verdana">...but perhaps the cleverest 
            plan to put the internet on wheels comes from a cunning scheme to 
            provide e-mail access in rural India using buses. Given the reach 
            of the bus network, it is estimated that this approach could provide 
            national e-mail coverage for a paltry $15m. E-mail by bus&#8212;why 
            not?<br>

            bridge the digital divide and jumpstart the rural communications market... 
            DakNet also builds human-resource development capacity by training
