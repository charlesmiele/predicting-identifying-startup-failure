         UV will sell pre-paid cards, with phone number and email address assigned to them, in different denominations (up to 100 rupees, roughly $2.20). &quot;One line gets shared by several thousand people,&quot; Mr. Hasson says, adding that a few transactions by individuals a month would make the service profitable for UV's Indian subsidiary.... &quot;Drishtee pays UV as their ISP, and the kiosk operator pays UV 95 cents per card sold.

              and deliver incoming e-mail. The school's computer system and antenna 
              are powered by solar panels. Newly collected data is stored for the 
              day in a computer strapped to the back of the motorcycle. At dusk, 
              the motorcycles converge on the provincial capital, Ban Lung, where 
              an advanced school is equipped with a satellite dish, allowing a bulk

            perhaps the cleverest plan to put the internet on wheels comes from 
            a cunning scheme to provide e-mail access in rural India using buses. 
            Given the reach of the bus network, it is estimated that this approach 
            could provide national e-mail coverage for a paltry $15m. E-mail by
