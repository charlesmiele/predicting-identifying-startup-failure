         UV will sell pre-paid cards, with phone number and email address assigned to them, in different denominations (up to 100 rupees, roughly $2.20). &quot;One line gets shared by several thousand people,&quot; Mr. Hasson says, adding that a few transactions by individuals a month would make the service profitable for UV's Indian subsidiary.... &quot;Drishtee pays UV as their ISP, and the kiosk operator pays UV 95 cents per card sold.

              and deliver incoming e-mail. The school's computer system and antenna

              day in a computer strapped to the back of the motorcycle. At dusk, 
              the motorcycles converge on the provincial capital, Ban Lung, where

            perhaps the cleverest plan to put the internet on wheels comes from 
            a cunning scheme to provide e-mail access in rural India using buses. 
            Given the reach of the bus network, it is estimated that this approach 
            could provide national e-mail coverage for a paltry $15m. E-mail by
