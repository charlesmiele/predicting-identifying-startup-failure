            <p class="style3">People in isolated villages can buy prepaid cards with a phone number and e-mail address assigned to them to write e-mails or record phone messages and then save this information at computer kiosks installed in schools and community halls. A wireless network called DakNet, which uses buses, motorcycles and trucks with short-range Wi-Fi antennas as mobile access points automatically picks up and delivers the stored messages and data to cities all over India with Internet connectivity, Hasson said. <br>

            <p><span class="style3"> The company recruits and trains entrepreneurs to operate kiosks installed with WiFi antennas along the vehicle's route where villagers can go to send and receive emails, SMS, voicemails, web searches, and take advantage of other locally-relevant products and services. When the vehicle with the MAP drives by each kiosk, it automatically picks up all of the kiosk's outgoing data and drops off all incoming data at wireless broadband speeds such that approximately 50MB can be transferred in the 3 minutes (on average) that the vehicle is in range... </span><span class="style3">DakNet is already benefiting thousands of villagers in India, Cambodia, Rwanda, and Paraguay... &quot;We believe that the most compelling evidence and reliable metric for our technology's positive impact is the amount of prepaid cards that we sell to our customers, which represents the vilage of the efficiencies created by the services that we offer,&quot; says Hasson.</span><br>

            <p class="style3">United Villages works through its franchisees in the villages  called DakNet Service providers' (DSPs), they run kiosks with wireless-enabled pcs. The DSP is also meant to help people who don't know how to use a computer. In fact, since most of the web is in English, villagers often rely on him for translations. As a result, the DSPs have become important men in their villages. I am more computer-savvy than any of the others in my village, and they all respect me for this, says Debiprasad Mishra, DSP of Pathrachakada village in Nayagarh district. </p>
            <p class="style3"> An e-commerce service was also launched a few weeks ago. A catalogue was drawn up after a survey on what kinds of products, not available locally, would interest the villagers  goods range from books to cosmetics, medicine and seeds. Customers order online and the products are generally delivered to the village kiosk. United Villages charges the mrp, its sole source of profit being the margin it negotiates with distributors.<br>

            <p class="style3">The system also made it easier for villagers to buy essential products such as fertilisers, pesticides, books and medicines, Mr Hasson added. "What we've done is created a catalogue of those products that they can order at the kiosk and get them delivered the next day via the bus," he said. </p>
            <p class="style3">"We're bringing e-commerce to rural India."</p>
            <p class="style3">Because many people in rural communities cannot read, and because the majority of the web is in English, villagers often rely on the person who operates the local computer to help them. Raj Kishor Swain, who runs the computer in the village of Satasankha, said he is now a popular man. </p>
            <p class="style3">"Right now, more and more people are asking me about what can be done on the PC and internet," he said. "My objective is to show to the village youth that having a PC with connectivity is a viable business so that more and more unemployed youth can take up this as a self-employment opportunity."<em><br>

            <p class="style3">Our new strategy has just been to look for the right partners within each of these countries. Typically it's a cellular company, or an ISP... We give our software away for free; sell our mobile access points at cost and they get the Wi-Fi equipment and the PCs locally. The trick is that it doesn't work without our prepaid cards. We want to enable these companies to start up these networks at a very low cost, but we want to take a piece of the service, the transaction revenue. So we'll sell prepaid cards to all these different operators in different countries, and take a percentage of their face value. Keeping the upfront costs as low as possible is really the key to unlocking this market.<br>

            <hr>
            <p class="style3">United Villages, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, developed technology to wirelessly connect isolated villages to the Internet, using Wi-Fi in an unusual way. Using pre-paid cards, locals in remote villages write emails or record phone messages and save their words at computer kiosks installed in schools and community halls&mdash;and this is where United Villages comes in. Using what United Villages calls DakNet, buses fitted out with short-range Wi-Fi antennas pass through villages, automatically picking up stored emails and voice messages as they go. Once a bus reaches a city with Internet connectivity, it relays the emails and messages to their appointed destinations via the web. </p>
            <p class="style8"><span class="style3">&ldquo;We're becoming the glue that sticks together those areas that have mobile connectivity and those that don't,&rdquo; Mr. Hasson explains...

But they too wish to take advantage of Internet services... The &ldquo;Internet Postmen&rdquo; of their Indian company, DakNet (www.unitedvillages.com) make their rounds by bike, truck, bus or boat with a short-range Wi-Fi antenna and a hard disk on board. In the villages that are served, a solar-powered computer and a Wi-Fi antenna sit enthroned in an &ldquo;Internet kiosk&rdquo;. For a few rupees, the villagers come everyday to drop off their emails, their files to be transmitted, their Google search requests, and even pre-recorded telephone messages... The highly economical service of prerecorded telephone messages sent using Internet telephony has proven to be a great success, to such an extent that in certain villages of Orissa (Central-Eastern India), the Internet postman passes by three times a day. In Cambodia, 150 schools also utilize this service, which is infinitely cheaper than a satellite connection. Rural areas of Costa Rica, Rwanda, and Paraguay are also served.</font></span><br>

            hills of northeastern Cambodia, five men on motorcycles are connecting 
            rural villages to one another, their government, medical specialists 
            and the Internet... the Village Area Networking Kit is expected to 
            be priced at $500 to $600 when released, a fraction of the cost of 
            the electricity and communications infrastructure that would otherwise 
            be necessary to deliver e-mail to the villages.<br>

            perhaps the cleverest plan to put the internet on wheels comes from 
            a cunning scheme to provide e-mail access in rural India using buses. 
            Given the reach of the bus network, it is estimated that this approach 
            could provide national e-mail coverage for a paltry $15m. E-mail by 
            bus&#8212;why not?<br>

            to bridge the digital divide and jumpstart the rural communications 
            market... DakNet also builds human-resource development capacity by
