<p align="left" content="">Cerberians Internet Management Service is the most 
  effective and efficient URL content filtering solution available, ensuring a 
  safer, more productive Internet experience for businesses, homes and schools. 
  Cerberian is the only solution uniquely positioned to provide a value-add service 
  directly integrated on a firewall, caching device, network appliance or service 
  solution. The Cerberian solution is built on the managed service business model. 
  This minimizes the customer's need for expensive IT hardware and ongoing maintenance 
  by putting the technology and file management burden at Cerberian's Data Centers. 
  The unique architecture features one of the Industries largest databases of 
  categorized Web sites and provides real-time ratings on any dynamically generated 
  Web site resulting in the most accurate, cost effective solution offered. The 
  Cerberian Internet Manager combines:Blocking, Monitoring, Real-time URL Rating, 
  Policy Management, Real-Time Reporting. Cerberian offers a better filtering 
  package than Websense. Cerberian's reporting feature is outstanding and has 
  allowed us to immediately track down some serious abuse of unauthorized surfing, 
  which could have led to serious consequences. We are impressed that Cerberian 
  is able to dynamically determine if a site is inappropriate and block it or 
  log a policy violation. Cerberian's ultra-light footprint and outsourced services 
  are an excellent complement to Cisco's small and medium enterprise offerings. 
  This also provides an opportunity for our Resellers to sell an essential outsourced 
  service from which their customers can derive significant benefit. During a 
  Vault.com survey, 28.83% of employees said that their employer had caught them 
  surfing non-work-related sites, although 54% of employers said that they have 
  caught an employee surfing non-work-related sites at work. The Cerberian Internet 
  Manager helps you become more productive and gives you a greater peace of mind.

<p align="left">Cerberian has developed proven technology that fits perfectly 
  into our Internet security appliances. Both Cerberian and SnapGear are committed 
  to providing affordable, easy-to-use products and services that feature cutting-edge 
  technology and require very little maintenance and support. Our customers will 
  appreciate Cerberian's integrated software, which manages, filters and reports 
  all Internet activity to maintain the integrity of their networks and the security 
  of their information. Cerberian offers a better filtering package than Websens. 
  Cerberian's reporting feature is outstanding and allowed us to immediately track 
  down some serious abuse of unauthorized surfing, which could have led to some 
  serious consequences in the future. We are impressed that Cerberian is able 
  to dynamically determine a site is inappropriate and block it or log a policy 
  violation. MSTAR and the LDS Church have a long history in the filtering space 
  as consumers of the technology. We feel that we are experts in the field and 
  are always on the hunt for the best of breed technology. Cerberian's outsourced 
  model along with their dynamic real-time URL rating puts them at the top of 
  my list when it comes to filtering solutions. Our SoftPak applications are an 
  integral part of the success of our firewall appliances. By partnering with 
  companies like Cerberian, we have assured our customers of a complete security 
  package that features a combination of cutting edge hardware and software technologies. 
  Cerberian has developed a product that makes it easy for companies to manage, 
  secure and protect their Internet access, and we are pleased to have the company 
  as a partner. Cerberian is definitely the next-generation of this high-demand 
  technology. We are thrilled to take Cerberian into Japan where our customers 
  are demanding this kind of distributed architecture. More accurate ratings, 
  more efficient delivery, and global reporting make Cerberian a winner. Cerberian 
  is simply better than the competition.</p>
