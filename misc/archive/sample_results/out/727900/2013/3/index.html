			<h2>Therapeutic Focus</h2>
			<p>Sprout is focused in the field of female sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD) is described clinically as when a women experiences distress due to problems with sexual desire, arousal, orgasm or pain. FSD in women is believed to be significantly more common than erectile dysfunction in men. Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, or HSDD, is the most common complaint among women experiencing sexual dysfunction. HSDD is defined as the lack of or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity that causes significant personal distress or interpersonal difficulty (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>Etiology</h3>
<p>A number of potential causes and contributing factors to HSDD have been identified, indicative of a complex interaction of physiological, psychological, emotional and/or relationship components.</p>
<p>It is widely accepted that the brain plays a central role in sexual function and female sexual desire. Current medical research suggests that neurotransmitters in the brain (particularly dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin) play an important role in modulating sexual desire. Consequently, sexual dysfunctions could occur when the balance of these neurotransmitters is disrupted. Diminished function of the dopamine system, which increases sexual desire and excitement, and the norepinephrine system, which affects arousal and orgasm, may lead to the inability to begin the sexual response cycle. An overactive serotonin system, which can decrease desire and delay orgasm, may also lead to inhibition of sexual response. If these neurotransmitter systems are not appropriately balanced, sexual dysfunction may result. Women with HSDD may have an imbalance in these systems, which may, in turn, affect the typical progression of the sexual response cycle and the ability to experience sexual desire. Pharmaceutical intervention into the biochemical component of sexual dysfunction shows promise but to date, no drugs are approved and marketed in the United States.</p>
<h3>Diagnosis &amp; Prevalence</h3>
<p>The prevalence of HSDD is significant. In 1999, the National Health and Social Life Survey assessed sexual functioning among men and women in the U.S. The survey reported that 43% of women experienced some type of sexual dysfunction compared to 31% of men (Laumann, 1999). In women, the most common complaint was low sexual desire (22%). The Global Study of Sexual Attitudes and Behaviors found similar results in a larger-scaled international survey of sexual problems among men and women 40 to 80 years of age. The GSSAB found that 26% to 43% of women experienced low sexual desire compared to 13% to 28% of men (Laumann et al., 2006). In 2006, the Women&#8217;s International Study of Health and Sexuality (&#8220;WISHeS&#8221;) assessed the prevalence of HSDD and how it affected quality of life among U.S. women based on their reproductive status and age. The WISHeS study found that 24% to 36% of women between 20 and 70 years of age had problems with low sexual desire (Lieblum et al., 2006). In addition, the percentage of younger surgically menopausal women with HSDD between 20 to 49 years of age was significantly greater (26%) versus pre-menopausal women in the same age group (14%). WISHeS concluded that HSDD is prevalent among women of all ages, regardless of reproductive status.</p>
<h3>Treatment of HSDD</h3>
<h3><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;"> Currently, there is no FDA-approved treatment for pre-menopausal women with HSDD.  Sprout’s focus is to commercialize a therapy to meet this important unmet medical need.</span></h3>
